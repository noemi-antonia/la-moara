## La moara

Javascript course organized by cognizant softvision

### First Course

- we set up the followings: Git, VSCode, nodejs
- we created a simple stylized page
- to run the created static page, we used nodemon with express js to automatically detect changes in the project and restart when change is detected

**Homework:**

1. create a new github repo which will be used for all the themes we will receive in future courses
2. create a HTML page about a favorite topic ( for ex, your favorite pet) and include the followings:
   - at least 5 different HTML elements
   - at least one class selector and one id selector with their styles
   - at least one style that will be applied to multiple child elements ( for ex: `.blog-text p`, `.blog-text a`, `.blog-text span`)
3. following the steps from the first course, create a server that will display the created page
